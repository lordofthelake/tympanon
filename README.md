*a small, embeddable, modular Java web server*

## What is Tympanon?

Tympanon is a minimalist HTTP web server, designed to be used as a library. It doesn't attempt to be a full-featured webserver, 
but its purpose is to be complete enough to be useful. It has been started as a study project, but has then be refactored as a general-purpose tool.  
  
**Features:**    

* Compliance with a subset of HTTP/1.1
* Can serve both static and dynamic content
* Modular: it can be augmented with lightweight, servlet-like classes to serve dynamic content
* Small footprint, ideal in a mobile environment (Android)
* REST-oriented: makes simple to expose REST-style services
